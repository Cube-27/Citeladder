# AI visibility diagnosis

## Goal

Find where a relevant buyer question fails to produce a useful, accurate mention of the brand, and pick the next fix from the actual answers. Do not apply a generic "AEO checklist" or guess at a model's private ranking logic.

## Read the right data

1. `read_visibility_overview` for the latest completed run and its status. If it has no completed run, say there is no usable baseline.
2. `read_visibility_results` with that `audit_id` for the actual answers. Filter by `prompt_id`, `domain` or `url` to narrow. If a result only summarizes a record, open it with `fetch`.
3. `read_visibility_sources` with the same `audit_id` for cited domains (`level: domain`) or URLs (`level: url` with `domain`).
4. As needed: `read_visibility_overview` for headline rates, `read_prompt_portfolio` for which prompts are tracked, `get_project_business_context` for offers and competitors.
5. For how answers portray the brand, `read_perception` with the same `audit_id` (`view: quotes` for the verified quotes): always state its coverage ("N of M mentions classified"); a pending or unavailable read has no value, never zero. Sources it lists were cited alongside criticism, never shown to cause it.
6. For ads in ChatGPT Search answers, `read_ai_ads` with the same `audit_id`: ads are paid placements; report them separately, never as citations, sources or a cause of visibility, and an engine without ads is not applicable, never zero.

Engines and surfaces are whatever the data shows; do not assume a fixed set. Keep `core` and `comparison` cohorts separate. A summary-only read supports only a summary-level finding. Report answers as unavailable only after the read fails or says they are absent.

## Diagnose

1. **Check the prompts first.** Separate unbranded discovery, branded and informational prompts. A high mention rate on prompts that name the brand does not prove discovery. Note failed runs and changes in prompt, engine or cohort mix.
2. **Read the decisive answers.** For each, note separately: cited, mentioned, recommended, recommended against, or misstated. A citation is not an endorsement; no citation does not prove the page was never retrieved. Check aliases, negation and context; a similar substring is not a mention.
3. **Look at sources.** Map cited domains and URLs to who controls them (owned, competitor, independent publisher, platform). A brand's own YouTube video is owned content, not independent validation. Count appearances per distinct prompt run with a stated denominator; one repeated prompt is not many buyer needs.
4. **Classify the failure:**
   - **Measurement problem:** weak, leading or noncommercial prompts, wrong market, failed runs. Fix the prompts before the content.
   - **Access problem:** a key owned page is shown to be blocked or broken. Absence from answers alone does not prove blocking.
   - **Answer gap:** owned content lacks the explanation, proof or decision detail. Name the page and what is missing.
   - **Source gap:** a frequently cited independent source covers alternatives but omits or misstates the brand.
   - **Fit gap:** the answer knows the brand but prefers another option. Check whether that limitation is real; never write false superiority claims.
   - **Volatility:** results differ across runs or engines. Look at repeated runs before calling one loss a trend.
5. **Compare competitors fairly.** Keep direct competitors apart from publishers. Look at what claims or criteria earn their inclusion, not just mention counts.
6. **Owned-page gaps.** `read_content_differentiation` returns up to 10 reports comparing an owned page with inspected organic results. Use the report for the relevant prompt if one is listed; if none is, treat the comparison as unavailable, not as parity. Quote any gap with its count out of pages inspected, and call a topic "unique" only within that inspected set. These are organic results, not AI citations.

## Rules

- No universal schema bonus, ideal paragraph length, "AI readiness" score or forecast.
- An answer without source URLs cannot support source-level analysis.
- For Google AI Overviews, separate "no AI Overview shown" from a provider error.
- Never drop valid losing answers to improve a rate.

## Deliver

For a direct question ("why are we missing?"), answer in a few paragraphs: what the answers actually show, the strongest next action, and the main remaining uncertainty.

For a full diagnosis, the document covers: what was measured (audit date, engines, prompt cohorts, coverage); outcomes by type; the failure types found, with the decisive answer excerpts; source and competitor gaps; prioritized actions; and how to re-measure on the same prompts and engines. When useful, add a table of key observations: prompt text, engine, date, mentioned, recommended, factual issue, short answer excerpt, cited URLs.
