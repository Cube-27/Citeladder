# Search Console optimization

## Pick the mode

- **Page optimization:** exact, evidence-linked edits to one page.
- **Decline diagnosis:** find which segment dropped and test the possible explanations.

Do not expand a single-page request into a sitewide rewrite. Never promise CTR or ranking gains.

## Getting the right data

- `read_integration_status` to confirm Search Console is connected and imported.
- `read_performance` for totals and period comparison.
- `read_performance_table` for one dimension at a time (query, page, country, device, day…). These tables are independent: they cannot tell you which queries belong to which page. Never combine a query table and a page table into page-level claims.
- `read_query_evidence` for queries linked to a specific page. It needs an exact saved window (`window_start`, `window_end`) and the page's `site_url_id`, which you get from `read_site_pages`. If no saved window exists, say which Search Console window must be synced, and offer only a clearly labelled content review meanwhile.
- `read_site_pages` also gives the page's saved facts.

Search Console omits some low-volume rows; report what was observed. Keep the provider's dates and timezone. Do not compare an incomplete week with a full one. CTR for a group is total clicks ÷ total impressions, never an average of row CTRs.

## A. Page optimization

1. Read the page's current title, headings, main content, call to action and links. Before/after edits need the real original text; never invent it.
2. Split queries into own-brand, competitor-brand and non-branded. Group them by the user question they express. Leave irrelevant queries out and say so.
3. For each group, judge: answered well, incomplete, ambiguous, missing, or wrong page. A missing exact phrase is not a content gap if the answer is already there.
4. Name the likely bottleneck: snippet mismatch, weak answer or proof, wrong intent, weak positioning, low visibility, or an access issue. Low CTR at a low position is not automatically bad copy.
5. Propose only the edits needed: clearer title or description, a missing answer, real proof, a useful detail, a better next step or a contextual link. For each: location, original text, proposed text, the query group and metrics behind it. If no edit is justified, say "keep" and why.

## B. Decline diagnosis

Confirm the drop exists in complete, comparable data. Quantify it and segment by page group, branded vs non-branded, country, device and time. Test explanations in this order: data or property change; seasonality or demand; tracking differences; site, release or indexing change; ranking or competitor shift; CTR or result-format change. Timing near a search update is not proof; do not state update dates from memory. For each explanation give what supports it, what argues against it, and the next check.

## Deliver

**Page mode**, one document: target URL, periods and coverage; a query-group table with metrics; the edits (location → original → proposed → why); queries left out; sections to keep unchanged; how to measure. Label edits as proposed, not applied.

**Decline mode**, one document: the observed change; affected and unaffected segments; data completeness; each explanation with support, counter-evidence and next check; prioritized fixes with exact targets.
