/**
 * Commerce is one screen, not four tabs.
 *
 * The tabs were verbs — Catalog, Competitors, Buyer Prompts, AI Shelf — and
 * each one re-asked the same noun, so the target selector was duplicated three
 * times over three selection states that never agreed. The catalog is the
 * navigation now and everything else is a view of the selected target, held in
 * `?target=`. A legacy `?tab=` value is simply ignored, which lands on the
 * workspace rather than a route that no longer exists.
