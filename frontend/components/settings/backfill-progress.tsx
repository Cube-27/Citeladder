/**
 * The history-import line on a connection card.
 *
 * Selecting a property enqueues a year of history as rolling-window-sized
 * chunks, which then drain in the background with nothing on screen to say
 * so. This renders that rollup: how many windows are done, and which dates
 * are actually covered once they are.
 *
 * Every state stays distinct (invariant 7). `not_started` renders NOTHING
 * rather than "0 of 0 windows": no import was ever enqueued, which is not
 * the same as an import that has covered nothing yet. `partial` says so
 * explicitly instead of reporting the coverage as complete.
