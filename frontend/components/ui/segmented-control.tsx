 * accessible; selection is fully controlled by the caller (react-hook-form).
 *
 * Keyboard model is the APG radio-group one: the group holds a single tab stop
 * (only the checked radio is tabbable), and the arrow keys move focus AND
 * selection between options, wrapping at both ends. Both axes are bound because
 * the control is visually horizontal but wraps to more than one row at narrow
 * widths, where Up/Down is what a user reaches for.
 *
 * `trailing` is for a control that shares the track but is NOT one of the
 * choices — Performance's "More" button, which opens the range dialog. It has to
 * sit outside the radio group (a radio does not open a dialog) while still
 * riding the same rail, which is why the group carries `display: contents`.
 * Without this slot the only way to get that layout was to rebuild the track by
 * hand, and the one place that did lost the radio semantics and the arrow keys
 * along with it.

 *
 * It lives here rather than at the call site for two reasons. The segment
 * geometry is a design-system recipe, and a feature that reaches for a raw
 * <button> to get it is exactly what `check:policy` rejects; and `Pressable`,
 * the only other sanctioned wrapper, is the ROW affordance — it forces
 * `w-full` and `text-left`, which is why the hand-built version of this
 * stretched its segments.
 *
 * It is a button, not a radio: it opens something rather than selecting a
 * value, so it takes `aria-haspopup` from the caller and never `aria-checked`.
 * `selected` is purely the visual state that says the active range is one of
 * the ones hiding behind it.
