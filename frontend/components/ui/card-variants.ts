/**
 * Card is a semantic object, not a structural layout container.
 *
 * A fine inset edge and layered elevation lift objects from workspace ground.
 * Dark surfaces use inset highlights. Status tones retain their explicit edge.
 *
 * The card deliberately sets no display of its own. Making it a flex column
 * would be convenient for pinning a `CardFooter`, but it would also re-flow
 * every card in the app and put an `overflow` boundary between a sticky child
 * and its scroll container. `CardGrid` opts a row into that column layout
 * instead, so only the cards that need aligned footers get it.
