 * different in six screens. `Card` could not absorb them: a Card may not nest
 * inside a Card, and most of these are structure rather than semantic objects.
 *
 * This is a class recipe, not a component, because these boxes land on `div`,
 * `li`, `section` and `dd` alike and the element must stay semantic.
