/**
 * Spinner — the one in-place loading indicator.
 *
 * Loading is a THIRD state, distinct from a measured value and from an
 * explicit missing one (invariant 7). A surface that renders "Not measured"
 * while a refetch is in flight states something it does not know yet, and the
 * placeholder flashing in and out of a value slot reads as data that appeared
 * and vanished. The spinner is what occupies that slot until the answer
 * arrives.
 *
 * Hand-rolled `LoaderCircle animate-spin` recipes previously gave each caller
 * its own size and accessibility treatment. One owner (invariant 2) keeps an
 * in-place loading state visually and semantically consistent.
