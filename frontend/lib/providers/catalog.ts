/**
 * Provider Settings view-model helpers (F8, v2 direct-provider retirement).

 * Turns the raw `/provider-catalog` payload + the workspace's
 * `/provider-connections` into the per-engine card model the UI renders. The
 * catalog is the single source of truth for which (logical engine → transport →
 * model) routes are available. After the direct-provider retirement each
 * logical engine has exactly ONE direct transport — ChatGPT/OpenAI,
 * Gemini/Google, Claude/Anthropic — so each card renders a single fixed direct
 * route with no toggle and no reserved "coming soon" option.
 *
 * Settings manages CREDENTIALS, not engines: one DataForSEO login serves every
 * consumer-app and search surface, so `buildProviderGroups` folds the engine
 * cards into one group per transport and a save routes all of them at once.
