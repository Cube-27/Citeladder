 * into "how many distinct phrases did it use" — every repeat was dropped before
 * anything could count it, so the fanout tab's occurrence column could never

 * about how hard an engine worked a prompt; de-duplication, where a view wants
 * it, belongs to that view and not to the capture path.
 *
 * Blank queries are still skipped: a count-only event (the provider ran a
 * search but withheld the wording) is not a query string, and the fanout tab
 * reports those separately as `undisclosed`.
