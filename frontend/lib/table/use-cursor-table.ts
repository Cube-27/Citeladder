/**
 * Keyset pagination state for a cursor-paged table: the cursor stack, the
 * rows-per-page selection, and the reset rule that keeps them honest.
 *
 * A keyset cursor is only meaningful against the exact result set it was cut
 * from. The backend binds every cursor to a fingerprint (project, snapshot,
 * tab, sort, page size) and REFUSES a replay against a different one, so the
 * client must drop its stack the moment any of those change — otherwise the
 * next page request is a guaranteed 400 rather than a page of rows.
 *
 * `scopeKey` is that fingerprint. Pass every value the server binds into it;
 * when it changes the stack resets to page one and the page-size selection is
 * preserved (a reader who chose 100 rows keeps 100 rows across tabs).
 *
 * Unlike an offset pager there is no page count to clamp to: `canNext` is
 * driven purely by whether the server returned a continuation cursor, so a
 * background refetch can never strand the reader past the end.
